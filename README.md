# Frontend Engineering Assignment

### Overview

The goal of this assignment is to:

1. Assess your ability to create pixel-perfect frontend UI experience from a Figma mockup
2. Evaluate the quality and efficiency of your frontend code

### Instructions

Create a production ready version of this UI mockup: https://www.figma.com/file/kIuMI4fBxEUIfrylsnV50o/Athlete-Studio---Frontend-Developer-Assignment?node-id=0%3A1

Follow these guidelines:

1. Create a project locally with either static html, css, js files or use the javascript framework of your choice.
2. Format the athlete data as json so it can be injested to generate html content.
3. Use either Sass or Less as css pre-processor. Create Mixins for the button and input styles.
4. You can use an external css library (example Tailwind) but only for grid and spacing.
5. Add functionality to the "Sort By" input so the cards can be sorted by Oldest and Newest.
6. Only show the first 12 athlete cards by default. Display the remaining 4 when the "Load More Athletes" button is clicked.
7. Make the UI mobile responsie by collapsing into rows of 2 on mobile screens.

### Closing

All project files should be delivered via Github within 72 hours of receiving the assignment with instructions to run the application locally. Best of luck!
